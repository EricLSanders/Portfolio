            Hi! My name is Eric Sanders and I'm an Applicaiton Consultant at Wonderware North. I graduated from Butler University (2014) with a degree in Software Engineering and Music Performance. Blending these two majors together has given me a great perspective on being a software engineer.

                My online portfolio was a recent project that I wanted to do. I'm not as experienced in front end development as I am with back end. Therefore, creating this portfolio was a create project. I've also enrolled in a few online courses to continue my learning in web dev. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan to continue to update my portfolio regularly adding new content and new fun things that I learn in front end dev.

                <h4> Android, iOS, HTML, Desktop</h4>
                Military Tower Defense (title in work) is a game that I've been working on for Android, iOS, HTML, and Desktop. It's a top down 2d tower defense game with a military theme. Players can place soldiers (towers) anywhere on the map and call in for aircraft support. It's slightly different than a typical tower defense game in that the waves of enemies can fire back and kill the towers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm in the process of finishing the graphics now. I hope to be able to release for Android, HTML, and Desktop in late 2016 and release for iOS in early 2017.

                <h4> Java </h4>
                For my cryptography class at Butler, we had a to write our own implementation of an RSA encryption. I had less than 24 hours to write it, and other than handling errors and failing gracefully, I thought it turned out well. Due to time constraints, I chose to write it in Java since I already had prior knowledge of dealing with BigIntegers.

                <h4> Java, Swing </h4>
                This was a midterm project for my cryptography class at Butler. We had to implement an encryption and decryption for a Shift, Affine, Substitution, and Vigenere Cipher. I went a levels beyond and also implements auto decryption for Shift and Vigenere Cipher. The auto decryption will automatically decrypt an encrypted text and give the shift or key that was used to encrypt the text. I also added a GUI rather than using a simple command prompt.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use Java for this project because I knew how to Swing. This allowed me to quickly create a GUI.

                I plan to add a web front end for ths app in the near future.

            I was fortunate enough to be nominated for Student Employee of the Year for Butler University by my supervisor Sheri Stormes while working at Irwin Library as a student employee in the Fine Arts. <a href="http://blogs.butler.edu/dawgblog/2014/04/student-employee-of-the-year/">I won the award for Student Employee of the Year </a> for Butler University and then also won Student Employee of the Year for the State of Indiana which combines all universities in Indiana. This was a huge honor for me and I'm very appreciative.
            <br><br>
            While working for Sheri Stormes in the Fine Arts Department of Irwin Library, I wrote a program to help assist myself and other co-workers with a very tedious task.
