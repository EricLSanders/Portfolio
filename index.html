            I first began programming when I was 12 years old. I began with Visual Basic 6 and quickly expanded from there - writing anything I could think of, from games to websites. When I was 13 I created a website dedicated to teaching and blogging about Visual Basic 6. I also created many youtube videos that garnered nearly 400,000 views. 
            </p>

            <p>
             I graduated from Butler University (2014) with a degree in Software Engineering and Music Performance. Blending these two majors together has given me a great perspective for being a software engineer. While I was in school, I was fortunate to have two internships that prepared me for professional positions. I interned at Simon Property Group as an Application Developer and at Rook Security as a Software Developer. 
             While at Simon I learned about enterprise software, design patterns, and Java Spring. I was also able to sharpen my object oriented programming skills. During my internship at Rook Security, I learned Python and was able to work as a member of the development team to develop new cyber security software.

            After graduating from Butler, I began working at Wonderware North as an Application Consultant. At Wonderware North, I work in small agile teams to deliver and implement custom solutions for customers. I have to wear many hats and be able to develop in different programming languages while utilizing different technologies. I must also gather requirements from customers and ensure quality deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm constantly striving to become a better software engineer. I'm frequently enrolled in online courses through places such as Coursera and MIT OpenCourseWare to futher develop my skills and broaden my knowledge. It's my goal to always be learning. In my freetime, I enjoy honing my skills by enrolling in online courses and working on multiple projects which can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/EricLeeSanders">GitHub</a>.

                My online portfolio was a recent project that I wanted to do. I'm not as experienced in front end development as I am with back end. Therefore, creating this portfolio was a good learning experience. I've also enrolled in a few online courses to continue my learning of web development.

                I plan to continue to update my portfolio regularly adding new content and new fun things that I learn in front end dev.

                <h4> Android, iOS, HTML, Desktop</h4>
                Military Tower Defense (title in work) is a game that I've been working on for Android, iOS, HTML, and Desktop. It's a top down 2d tower defense game with a military theme. Players can place soldiers (towers) anywhere on the map and call in for aircraft support to stop waves of enemie soldiers from reaching their base. It's slightly different than a typical tower defense game in that the waves of enemies can fire back and kill the towers.

            <p>
                I'm in the process of finishing the graphics now. I hope to be able to release for Android, HTML, and Desktop in late 2016 and release for iOS in early 2017.

                <h4> Java </h4>
                For my cryptography class at Butler, we had a to write our own implementation of an RSA encryption. I had less than 24 hours to write it, and other than handling errors and failing gracefully, it turned out well. It isn't a testament to my programming ability, but shows that I have some knowledge about cryptology. I chose to write it in Java since I already had prior knowledge of BigIntegers.

                <h4> Java, Swing </h4>
                This was a midterm project for my cryptography class at Butler. We had to implement encryption and decryption for a Shift, Affine, Substitution, and Vigenere Cipher. I went a few levels beyond by adding a GUI and also implementing auto decryption for Shift and Vigenere Cipher. The auto decryption will automatically decrypt an encrypted text and give the shift or key that was used to encrypt the text. Shift uses frequency analysis to determine the similarity between each shift and the English language. Vigenere uses the Friedman Test as well as the Kasiski Test to deteremine the keyword length. Then using frequency analysis from the shift cipher, we find the best match to the English language for each coset. Also utilizes the MVP and Observer design patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use Java for this project because I was familiar with Swing. This allowed me to quickly create a GUI.
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan to add a web front end for ths app in the near future and may add/improve auto decryptions.

            <p>
            I was fortunate enough to be nominated for Student Employee of the Year for Butler University by my supervisor Sheri Stormes while working at Irwin Library as a student employee in the Fine Arts. I won the award for Student Employee of the Year for Butler University and then also won Student Employee of the Year for the State of Indiana which combines all universities in Indiana. This was a significant honor and I'm proud to have received it.
            </p>
            <p>
            While working at Irwin Library, I wrote a program to help assist myself and other co-workers with a very tedious task that involved manually parsing a word document containing information about various pieces of music. The task was to sort this information by instrument instead of composer. With hundreds of pages and thousands of pieces of music, sorting manually would take anywhere from 5 - 10 hours. The program I wrote parsed the word document and sorted the pieces of music. It also utilized the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/microsoft-translator-java-api/">Microsft Translator API</a> to translate text in languages other than English. This program allowed the user to scan through each piece of music within the program in order to ensure correct parsing and to fix any out of order music. In the end, this brought the process down from an average of 7.5 hours to 30-45 minutes.
